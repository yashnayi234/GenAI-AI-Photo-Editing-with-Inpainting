# GenAI-AI-Photo-Editing-with-Inpainting

## 🖼️ AI Photo Editing with SAM and Diffusion Inpainting

This project is a fun and creative AI-powered image editing tool that lets you **change the background or the subject of any image** using simple clicks and text prompts. Built using the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** by Meta AI and Hugging Face's **Diffusion Inpainting**, the app combines cutting-edge segmentation and generative models for seamless visual manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload an image and click to select the subject
- 🪄 Automatically generate a precise mask using SAM
- 🎨 Replace the background with a custom AI-generated scene via text prompt
- 🔄 Or swap the subject while keeping the background
- ⚙️ Modify parameters like guidance scale and random seed for fine control
- 💻 Try it interactively using the integrated Gradio UI

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- 🤖 **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** – for subject segmentation
- 🌈 **Diffusers AutoPipelineForInpainting** – for background/subject inpainting using text prompts
- 🎛️ **Gradio** – for building the interactive UI
- ⚡ **PyTorch** – for GPU-accelerated deep learning
- 🐍 Jupyter Notebook – for development & experimentation

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload an Image** – Choose your photo.
2. **Click on the Subject** – Use point-based selection with SAM to generate a mask.
3. **Edit with Text** – Describe the new background or subject.
4. **Generate** – The inpainting model fills in the masked region with your prompt.
5. **Download the Result** – Or run further edits!

## ✨ Tips to Explore

- Use **prompt engineering** to generate highly specific scenes.
- Try different **Classifier-Free Guidance Scale** values for creative variations.
- **Iterative editing**: run the output through the app again for complex edits.
